    <h4>About the dish</h4>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.  </li>
        <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to make the dish</h4>
